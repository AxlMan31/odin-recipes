<h2>Delicious and Quick Vegan Lasgana Recipe</h2>
<p><strong>You&apos;re going to love this strawberry smoothie.</strong> This recipe is cold, creamy and satisfying, and its nutty strawberry flavor is truly crave-worthy.</p>
<p>In their most basic form, these strawberry smoothies require just four ingredientsâ€”<strong>strawberries, frozen bananas, almond milk and almond butter.</strong></p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>1.5 cups to 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk or water</li>
    <li>10 ounces (2 cups) frozen strawberries, thawed for 5 to 10 minutes</li>
    <li>1.5 cups frozen bananas (I freeze my bananas in 1/2&quot; slices)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup almond butter</li>
    <li>Optional nutrition boosters: 1/4 cup old-fashioned oats and/or 2 tablespoons flax seed</li>
    <li>1 to 2 teaspoons maple syrup, if desired for sweetness</li>

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<ol>
    <li>In a blender, combine all of the ingredients, starting with the almond milk.</li>
    <li>Blend on low until the blender gains traction, then ramp up to the highest speed as soon as possible (or if your blender has a smoothie function, that will work well). Use your blender&apos;s tamper, if you have one, and stop to scrape down the sides as necessary. If the strawberries refuse to break up, let the mixture rest for several minutes before trying again. Add up to 1/2 cup additional milk if necessary.</li>
    <li>Once the smoothie is completely smooth and creamy, taste and blend in maple syrup if you&apos;d like a sweeter smoothie. Divide the smoothie into 2 to 4 glasses, depending on your desired serving size. Serve immediately!</li>
</ol>
